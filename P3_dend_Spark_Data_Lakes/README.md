# Udacity Project 4: Data Lake
## Summary

Sparkify is a music streaming startup in which its customer database became large, bringing about new challenges to deliver data in a timely manner to analysts and data scientists.

The purpose of this project is to insert the current Data Warehouse into the Big Data reality.

## Data Lake

A Data lake will give the ability to deal with structured and unstructured data. It enables data analysts to perform ad-hoc and fast data explorations while allowing for new types of analytics such as machine learning and NLP.

In the context of a data lake, the dimensional modeling will also continue to remain a valuable practice.

## Data Sources

- **s3a://udacity-dend/song_data** : data about song and the artist of that song;
-  **s3a://udacity-dend/log_data** : log files generated by the streaming app based on the songs in the dataset above;

## Data Quality

- Removal of duplicates on dimension tables. 
- Replaced blanks and zeros with `null`.

## Scripts

- **etl.py**: Setup of the pipeline which executes the extraction of the JSON source files in S3, loads schema-on-read tables and then transform data with Data Quality checks, then loads data into tables in S3.
